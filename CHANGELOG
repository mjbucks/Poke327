ASSIGNMENT 1:
1/28/24 6:26 pm Started map generation assignment and starting to set up git repo.
1/28/24 8:59 pm Just finished adding tall/short grass, mountain and water random generation onto the map. Paths and centers are next, then done.
1/29/24 7:15 pm Spent an hour trying to connect pyrite to vscode while stuck in an infinite password loop. Started making paths and pokecenters once logged in.
1/29/24 9:11 pm Just finished adding paths and pokecenters/pokemarts. Code seems to work well and output is printing well.

ASSIGNMENT 2:
2/3/2024 2:00pm Started working on making map data structure.
2/3/2024 6:24pm Map data structure is made, and world is 2d array of pointers. N, S, E, W and fly work and use memory to save maps.
Now need to connect paths and deal with corners/edges of world.
2/4/2024 4:45 pm Worked late last night but I keep getting segmentation faults when trying to connect paths between maps. Not sure why at all.
2/5/2024 12:15 pm Worked late last night again and kept getting seg faults when trying to connect paths. Fixed some of the issues but debugging for now.
2/6/2024 6:00pm Working on restructuring my memory allocating and debugging my errors. Starting to make some progress but still lots of seg faults/errors.
2/6/2024 11:39pm Just finished restructing my memory, fixing bugs I found, and connecting the paths. All should work as intended as well as the corners and edge cases are fixed by blocking the path on the corners/edges. All that needs to be fixed is fly and add probability for pokemarts/pokecenters spawning and this assignment is DONE. It's been very challenging for me, but a great learning experience.

ASSIGNMENT 3:
2/11/2024 11:00am Starting adding heap data structure to project so that Dijsktra's can be implemented.
2/12/2024 6:30pm Adding player datatype and starting Dijkstra's.
2/13/2024 5:30pm Dijkstra's from last night is not working, I am making a new version based off of the professor's code from last week now.
2/19/2024 5:30pm I was stuck for a while so I took a break for a few days from the project. My mind is renewed and I am ready to fix my dijkstras and get it working.

ASSIGNMENT 4:
2/24/2024 11:00am Starting working on implementing game queue and refactoring code

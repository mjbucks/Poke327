This is a README file for the pokemon game for COM S 327 at Iowa State.

Assignment01: This is the map generation assignment. To run this, run 'make' in the terminal, and then run './MapGeneration'.
Once this has been done, the output of the map should be displayed. There should be trees, water, short/tall grass, mountains, a pokemart, and a pokecenter
printed to the console. There should also be paths going N-S and E-W, as well as the pmarts and pcenters should be along the path.

Assignment02: This is the world generation assignment. To run this, run 'make' in the terminal, and then run './main'.
Once this has been done, the output of the first map (0,0) will be printed. From here, you can move N, S, E, W, F (fly) and notice the paths
aligning as you move. Also, (0,0) spawns a guarenteed Pokemart and Pokecenter, but outside of that, probability decreases from ~50% to 0%
as you get farther from the center of the world. You also should not be able to move outside of the 401x401 map world limit,
either by flight or by manually moving to the world border.
